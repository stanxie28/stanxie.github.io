Abstract
------
This paper analyze Kinshasa’s traffic police agency to examine the systemic component of bureaucratic corruption, and quantify its impact on society. The “real” agency is best described as a unofficial organization operating in the shadow of the official norms of the state, where vertical and horizontal redistribution of unofficial income is fueled by supervisor collusion, creating a distinctive social cost.
