Hello! I am Haoyang (Stan) Xie. I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Professional at The University of Chicago [Becker Friedman Institute](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/). Prior to joining BFI, I received my M.A. from The University of Chicago, and B.A. from Peking University. 

My research focuses on political, behavioral and development economics. My research relies on our amazing research partner [Marakuja Kivu Research](https://marakujakivuresearch.com/).

## Research Highlights

### Socially Costly Quota Scheme
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/quota-figure.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
</p>
<left>63% unofficial police income is generated through a “quota scheme:” managers at police stations ask agents posted at street intersections to escort drivers to the stations, where the managers extract a bribe from the drivers. Experimentally decreasing the quota worsens the agency’s ability to to manage traffic, while not improving its ability to enforce the traffic code.</left> 

### Unofficial Revenue by Distributional Concerns
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/income-figure.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
</p>
<left>We conduct a randomized cash transfer with the police agents where agents receive a payment perceived to be an unofficial perk from office and equal to their bribe revenue. 30% of that extra income is informally taxed away by the agents' commanders.</left> 

### Decay of State Capacity Over Distance 
<p align="center">

</p>
<left>By measuring the rate of decay of state capacity over distance to the state offices, I find that each kilometer away from a state office, state capacity decreases in 5%.</left>
