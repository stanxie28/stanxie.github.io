Hello! I am Haoyang (Stan) Xie. I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Professional at The University of Chicago [Becker Friedman Institute](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/). Prior to joining BFI, I received my M.A. from The University of Chicago, and B.A. from Peking University. 

My research focuses on political, behavioral and development economics. My research relies on our amazing research partner [Marakuja Kivu Research](https://marakujakivuresearch.com/).

## Research Highlights

### Socially Costly Quota Scheme
<p align="center">

</p>
<left>We analyze the organization of corruption in a state agency. The dual mandate of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s traffic police agency is to manage traffic and to enforce the traffic code. We first document that, in the capital’s branch, Kinshasa, traffic violation fines account for only 22% of the revenue of the branch. The remaining 78%, unofficial, comes from bribes paid by drivers, of which 63% is generated through a “quota scheme:” managers at police stations ask agents posted at street intersections to escort drivers to the stations, where the managers extract a bribe from the drivers. Experimentally decreasing the quota, hence mitigating its effect, we find that the quota scheme worsens the agency’s ability to fulfill its first mandate, while not improving its ability to fulfill the second. First, the quota causes 65% of all traffic jams and almost all accidents at the branch’s intersections. Second, we find evidence suggesting that it fuels false allegations against drivers—extortion—at a higher rate than it fuels true ones, consistent with the scheme not creating incentives to comply with the code. The findings emphasize that the manager’s demand for unofficial revenue is significant and creates profits and distortions beyond those that would be made possible via corruption by individual state officials.</left> 

### Unofficial Revenue by Distributional Concerns
<p align="center">

</p>
<left>Covert payments from state officials to their supervisors (supervisor kickbacks) are a frequently overlooked phenomenon. We conduct a within-individual randomized cash transfer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s traffic police agency to analyze supervisor kickbacks. First, kickbacks are widespread with average and marginal kickback rates similar to income taxation in Western European countries, but vary enormously between state officials. Supervisors are  able to learn about the top-up income of the officials they supervise. Kickbacks are progressive, with steeply increasing marginal kickback rates. Second, kickbacks are, in part, motivated by the reduction of inequality between the officials. Third,  failing to include supervisor/agent collusion vastly underestimates how prohibitive it is to reduce corruption through government official compensation if the supervisor cares about his revenue from kickbacks. These findings suggest that  unofficial systems of corruption are in part governed by inequality concerns and can significantly hamper the benefits of policies that ignore them.</left> 

### Decay of State Capacity Over Distance 
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/capacity-figure.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
</p>
<left>I present one measure of state capacity and applies it to characterize how state capacity varies over space. To identify economic operators' belief about legal capacity, I use a sale on credit design, in which buyers have room to defect on a promise to pay within three days, and randomized whether the buyers sign a formal contract invoking legal sanctions if they fail to pay. I use the estimation to analyze the buyers' implied unobservable belief about the cost faced by the buyer upon violating the formal contract. Using counterfactuals, I show that, on average, the level of state capacity is 21\% of the level that would bring cheating to 1\%. I then measure the rate of decay of such  state capacity so-defined over the distance to the state offices. I find that each kilometer away from a state office, state capacity decreases by 5\%. My findings represent a first attempt to empirically quantify  legal capacity as defined in the theoretical literature, and use that to show that state weakness is heterogeneous over space.</left>
