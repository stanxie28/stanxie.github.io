Hello! I am Haoyang Xie (Stan). I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Professional at The University of Chicago [Becker Friedman Institute](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/). Prior to joining BFI, I received my M.A. from The University of Chicago, and B.A. from Peking University. 

My research focuses on political, behavioral and development economics. My research relies on the great research partner [Marakuja Kivu Research](https://marakujakivuresearch.com/).
