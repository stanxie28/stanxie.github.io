Hello! I am Haoyang (Stan) Xie. I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Professional at The University of Chicago [Becker Friedman Institute](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/). Prior to joining BFI, I received my M.A. from The University of Chicago, and B.A. from Peking University. 

My research focuses on political, behavioral and development economics. My research relies on our amazing research partner [Marakuja Kivu Research](https://marakujakivuresearch.com/).

## Research Highlights

### Socially Costly Quota Scheme
<p align="center">

</p>
<left>63% unofficial police income is generated through a “quota scheme:” managers at police stations ask agents posted at street intersections to escort drivers to the stations, where the managers extract a bribe from the drivers. Experimentally decreasing the quota worsens the agency’s ability to to manage traffic, while not improving its ability to enforce the traffic code.</left> 

### Kickbacks Motivated by Distributional Concerns
<p align="center">

</p>
<left>We conduct a within-individual randomized cash transfer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s traffic police agency to analyze supervisor kickbacks. Kickbacks are widespread with average and marginal kickback rates similar to income taxation in Western European countries, but vary enormously between state officials.</left> 

### Decay of State Capacity over Distance 
<p align="center">
<img src="/images/capacity-figure.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
</p>
<left>I present one measure of state capacity and applies it to characterize how state capacity varies over space. Each kilometer away from a state office decreases state capacity by 5%. My findings represent a first attempt to empirically quantify  legal capacity as defined in the theoretical literature, and use that to show that state weakness is heterogeneous over space.</left>
